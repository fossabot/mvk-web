It uses\n * modern `flexbox` for layout making it super responsive and performant. Leaving most of the layout heavy lifting\n * to the browser. __note:__ The default styles use `height: 100%` which means your container must set an explicit\n * height (feel free to adjust the styles to suit your specific needs).\n *\n * Big Calendar is unopiniated about editing and moving events, prefering to let you implement it in a way that makes\n * the most sense to your app. It also tries not to be prescriptive about your event data structures, just tell it\n * how to find the start and end datetimes and you can pass it whatever you want.\n *\n * One thing to note is that, `react-big-calendar` treats event start/end dates as an _exclusive_ range.\n * which means that the event spans up to, but not including, the end date. In the case\n * of displaying events on whole days, end dates are rounded _up_ to the next day. So an\n * event ending on `Apr 8th 12:00:00 am` will not appear on the 8th, whereas one ending\n * on `Apr 8th 12:01:00 am` will. If you want _inclusive_ ranges consider providing a\n * function `endAccessor` that returns the end date + 1 day for those events that end at midnight.\n */\n\nvar Calendar = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Calendar, _React$Component);\n\n  function Calendar() {\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, Calendar);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args))), _this), _initialiseProps.call(_this), _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  Calendar.prototype.render = function render() {\n    var _props = this.props,\n        view = _props.view,\n        toolbar = _props.toolbar,\n        events = _props.events,\n        culture = _props.culture,\n        _props$components = _props.components,\n        components = _props$components === undefined ? {} : _props$components,\n        _props$formats = _props.formats,\n        formats = _props$formats === undefined ? {} : _props$formats,\n        _props$messages = _props.messages,\n        messages = _props$messages === undefined ? {} : _props$messages,\n        style = _props.style,\n        className = _props.className,\n        elementProps = _props.elementProps,\n        current = _props.date,\n        props = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['view', 'toolbar', 'events', 'culture', 'components', 'formats', 'messages', 'style', 'className', 'elementProps', 'date']);\n\n    formats = (0, _formats2.default)(formats);\n    messages = (0, _messages2.default)(messages);\n\n    var View = this.getView();\n    var names = viewNames(this.props.views);\n\n    var viewComponents = (0, _defaults2.default)(components[view] || {}, (0, _omit2.default)(components, names), {\n      eventWrapper: _EventWrapper2.default,\n      dayWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default,\n      dateCellWrapper: _BackgroundWrapper2.default\n    });\n\n    var CalToolbar = components.toolbar || _Toolbar2.default;\n    var label = View.title(current, { formats: formats, culture: culture });\n\n    return _react2.default.createElement(\n      'div',\n      _extends({}, elementProps, {\n        className: (0, _classnames2.default)('rbc-calendar', className, {\n          'rbc-rtl': props.rtl\n        }),\n        style: style\n      }),\n      toolbar && _react2.default.createElement(CalToolbar, {\n        date: current,\n        view: view,\n        views: names,\n        label: label,\n        onViewChange: this.handleViewChange,\n        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n        messages: messages\n      }),\n      _react2.default.createElement(View, _extends({\n        ref: 'view'\n      }, props, formats, {\n        messages: messages,\n        culture: culture,\n        formats: undefined,\n        events: events,\n        date: current,\n        components: viewComponents,\n        getDrilldownView: this.getDrilldownView,\n        onNavigate: this.handleNavigate,\n        onDrillDown: this.handleDrillDown,\n        onSelectEvent: this.handleSelectEvent,\n        onSelectSlot: this.handleSelectSlot,\n        onShowMore: this._showMore\n      }))\n    );\n  };\n\n  return Calendar;\n}(_react2.default.Component);\n\nCalendar.propTypes = {\n\n  /**\n   * Props passed to main calendar `<div>`.\n   */\n  elementProps: _propTypes2.default.object,\n\n  /**\n   * The current date value of the calendar.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm A fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `ENTERING`\n *  - `ENTERED`\n *  - `EXITING`\n *  - `EXITED`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?
